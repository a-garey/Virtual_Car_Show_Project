    <h3>Display participants' names and car photos here?</h3>
    <p>Where ever they're displayed, can use jQuery carousel to display pictures.</p>
    <p>Have voting options appear only if today's date matches the car show date and only participants can vote, but not on their own car.</p>

    <h3>Right side panel of sponsor logos?</h3>
    <p>Sponsers sponser show to advertise their business so if sponsor logos are to the right they're still visiable but kinda out of the way also so people can focus on the cars mainly.</p>
